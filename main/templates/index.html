            <p>Admission procedure under entrance test in Indian Education System is very complex. There are tens and
                hundreds
                of reservation quotas based on caste, religion, language, profession etc. Each college has limited
                intake of
                seats and majority percentage of seats are reserved as per government regulations. These reserved seats
                are
                further divided among different reservation categories. </p>
            <p>So, each college end up with having their seat distributed among lots of reservation category. Moreover,
                admission to these seats is done based on the rankings obtained in entrance exam by the student. Each
                reservation category seat has different fees structure to be paid by the students.</p>

                is the
                cut off rank for different reservation category? What is the fees structure for various reservation
                category?
